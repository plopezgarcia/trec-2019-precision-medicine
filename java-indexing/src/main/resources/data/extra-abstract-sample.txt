Title: Effect of food on the pharmacokinetics of dronabinol oral solution versus dronabinol capsules in healthy volunteers.



Background: Dronabinol capsule containing a pharmaceutical tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) is approved for anorexia associated with weight loss in patients with AIDS and for cancer chemotherapy-induced nausea/vomiting in patients with inadequate response to conventional antiemetic therapy. The effects of food on absorption and bioavailability of dronabinol oral solution was compared with capsules. Methods: In an open-label, single-dose, 3-period crossover study, healthy volunteers were randomized to receive dronabinol oral solution 4.25 mg (fed) or dronabinol capsule 5 mg (fed or fasted). Dosing was separated by a 7-day washout period and administered under a fasted (overnight) or fed state (high-fat/calorie meal 30 minutes prior to dosing). Plasma pharmacokinetics was evaluated for dronabinol and the major metabolite, 11-OH-9-THC. Results: Pharmacokinetic data were available for analysis in 54 volunteers. In the fed state, initial dronabinol absorption was rapid with oral solution vs capsules (mean Tlag , 0.15 vs 2.02 h, respectively). Further, in the fed state, 100% and 15% of volunteers receiving oral solution and capsules, respectively, had detectable plasma dronabinol levels 30 minutes post-dose. Inter-individual variability in plasma dronabinol concentrations during early absorption was less with oral solution vs capsules with %CV of 82.79%, 83.94%, and 90.68% and 318.54%, 250.33%, and 182.01% observed at 0.5, 1, and 2 h, respectively, following dosing. Food increased mean AUC0-t similarly for dronabinol oral solution and capsules vs capsules with fasting, increasing exposure to oral solution and capsules 2.1- to 2.4-fold. Mean time to maximum plasma concentration was similarly delayed for dronabinol oral solution (7.7 h) and capsules (5.6 h) with food vs capsules in the fasted state (1.7 h). Under fed conditions, AUC0-t and AUC0-inf were similar for the oral solution and capsules based on 11-OH-9-THC levels. Conclusions: An appreciable food effect was observed for dronabinol oral solution and capsules. Dronabinol oral solution may offer therapeutic benefit to patients given its rapid absorption and lower inter-individual variability vs dronabinol capsules. Clinical trial information: NCT01448772
